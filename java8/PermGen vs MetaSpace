PermGen
==========
It is removed from java 8.
PermGen always has a fixed maximum size.
Inside Java Heap Memory.
Ineffiecient garbage collection.
To avoid "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space" set maximum PermGen by -XX:MaxPermSize=200m //  ‘g' for GB, ‘m' for MB and ‘k' for KB.


MetaSpace
===========
It is introduced in Java 8.
It can grow its size dynamically depending on the underlying OS and do not have any size constraint.
Inside Native Memory(provided by underlying OS).

To avoid "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace" set maximum MetaSpace by -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m


***If we want to restart the server as soon as out of memory occur, we can set the parameter
-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="shutdown -r"

***If we want to assign minimum 2 GB and maximum 5 GB to JVM, we need to write:
-Xms2G -Xmx5G // -Xms means minimal heap size and -Xmx means maximal heap size
