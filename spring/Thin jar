1) Add dependency "spring-boot-thin-layout" under dependencies for plugin "spring-boot-maven-plugin".
2) --log-file C:\Users\Public\logs\mvn.log -e clean install -f build_pom.xml -Dthin.root=C:\Users\shankar\.m2
3) The whole point of thin jars is to avoid bundling the dependencies with the application. However, dependencies don't magically disappear, they're simply stored elsewhere.
If Fat jar size is 150 mb then Thin jar size is 20 mb

Types of JARs

1. Skinny – Contains ONLY the bits you literally type into your code editor, and NOTHING else.
2. Thin – Contains all of the above PLUS the app’s direct dependencies of your app (db drivers, utility libraries, etc).
3. Hollow – The inverse of Thin – Contains only the bits needed to run your app but does NOT contain the app itself. Basically a pre-packaged “app server” to which you can later deploy your app, in the same style as traditional Java EE app servers, but with important differences, we’ll get to later.
4. Fat/Uber – Contains the bit you literally write yourself PLUS the direct dependencies of your app PLUS the bits needed to run your app “on its own”.
