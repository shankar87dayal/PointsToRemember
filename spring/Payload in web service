he term 'payload' is used to distinguish between the 'interesting' information in a chunk of data or similar, and the overhead to support it. 
It is borrowed from transportation, where it refers to the part of the load that 'pays': for example, a tanker truck may carry 20 tons of oil, but the fully loaded vehicle weighs much more than that - there's the vehicle itself, the driver, fuel, the tank, etc. 
It costs money to move all these, but the customer only cares about (and pays for) the oil, hence, 'pay-load'.


In programming, the most common usage of the term is in the context of message protocols, to differentiate the protocol overhead from the actual data. Take, for example, a JSON web service response that might look like this (formatted for readability):

{
    "status":"OK",
    "data":
        {
            "message":"Hello, world!"
        }
}

In this example, the string "Hello, world!" is the payload, the part that the recipient is interested in; the rest, while vital information, is protocol overhead.
