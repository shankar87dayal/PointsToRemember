If any microservice get down due to some reason then entire microservice system (combination of many microservices) or other microservice(in which it is called/consumed) should not get down and throw exception to client.
If any microservice is down then other microservice(in which it is called/consumed) must retry again and again and handle this exception gracefully if exception continue.

Assume Product microservice as a consumer try to consume Coupon microservice.
Assume Coupon microservice is down and thus product microservice (where it is consumed) is handled.

************************************ Steps *************************************************************

1) Add depency in pom.xml of Product microservice
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop
io.github.resilience4j:resilience4j-spring-boot2

2) In Product microservice at required method we have to retry and handle the fallback gracefully.

@RequestMapping("productapi")
public class ProductRestController{

@Autowired
CouponClient couponClient;

@Autowired
privateproductRepo repo;

Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ProductRestController.class);

@RequestMapping(value = "/products", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@Retry(name = "product-api", fallbackMethod = "getInvoiceFallback") // "product-api" is unique retry instance with fallbackMethod configured.
public Product create(@RequestBody Product product){
	logger.info("create() call starts here");
	Coupon coupon = couponClient.getCoupon(product.getCouponCode()); // If Coupon microservice is down then only retry will happen.
	product.setPrice(product.getPrice().subtract(coupon.getDiscount()));
	return repo.save(product);
}

public Product getInvoiceFallback(Product product, Exception e) { // Same signature as create method with Exception as an additional parameter.
         logger.info("---RESPONSE FROM FALLBACK METHOD---"); // In log file
         return product; // In client(browser), get dummy "product" instead of exception. This "product" will not get inserted in db via privateproductRepo.
      }


}


3)In application.properties of Product microservice, define max-attempts and duration of each attempt (along with exception type, mostly ignored)
resilience4j.retry.instances.product-api.max-attempts = 2 // Default is 3
resilience4j.retry.instances.product-api.wait-duration = 3s // Default is 500 milliSeconds
resilience4j.retry.instances.product-api.retry-exceptions = org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException // Retry happens only when exeption "org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException" is thrown. 
                                                                                                                   // If want retry for all exception then remove this property fully. -- By Default.


************************************ Flow *************************************************************
1) Hit below
URL: http://localhost:9095/productapi/products
Method: POST
Body: Raw JSON

2) 
If coupon is up, then new product is creted & get inserted in db via privateproductRepo.
						                    OR
If coupon is down, then product create() will do retry 2 times each 3 seconds to get response from Coupon microservice. If get response then new product is creted & get inserted in db via privateproductRepo.
If even after retrying 2 attempts, still Coupon microservic is down & not giving any response then will handle exception and send gracefull message by call getInvoiceFallback method (as fallbackMethod = "getInvoiceFallback" is configured for retry).
