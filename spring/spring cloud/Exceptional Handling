"Exception tracking" Design Pattern
========================================
You have applied the Microservice architecture pattern. 
The application consists of multiple services and service instances that are running on multiple machines. 
Errors sometimes occur when handling requests. 
When an error occurs, a service instance throws an exception, which contains an error message and a stack trace.
