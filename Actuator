====================================================Actuator====================================================
The spring-boot-actuator module provides all of Spring Bootâ€™s production-ready features.

** health tell about application up or not,database up or not,disk space detail and many more.

1) Add dependency spring-boot-starter-actuator.
2) By default, all endpoints except for shutdown are enabled.
3) Enable endpoint as required, but instead of this use 4.
management.endpoint.info.enabled=true

*** Disabled endpoints are removed entirely from the application context. If you want to change only the technologies over which an endpoint is exposed, use the include and exclude properties instead.
 
4) If want to enable endpoint info, health on web instead of JMX
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=info, health
To include or exclude over web
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=* // All endpoint enabled
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=info

To include or exclude over jmx 
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=*
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude=health
