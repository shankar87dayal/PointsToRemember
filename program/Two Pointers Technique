Two pointers is really an easy and effective technique that is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array.
Given a sorted array A (sorted in ascending order), having N integers, find if there exists any pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) such that their sum is equal to X.

Steps
1) If (i+j)>X then i=i & j=j+1
        OR
   If (i+j)<X then i=i+1 & j=j
2) till (i+j)=X
