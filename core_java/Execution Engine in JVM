Execution Engine in JVM
This component executes the bytecode which is assigned to the runtime data areas through the classloader.
The execution engine has three major sub-components

1) Interpreter: This component reads the bytecode instructions and executes them in a sequential manner. 
The component runs the application from the command line by accepting a filename argument.

2) JIT (Just In Time) Compiler: This component counterbalance the Interpreterâ€™s disadvantage of slow execution and improves the performance. 
JIT compiler compiles the similar part of the bytecode at the same time and thus reduces the total time needed for compilation. 
The compiler in this component refers to a translator which converts the JVM instruction set to the OS-specific instruction set.

3) Garbage Collection: This component is a part of execution engine which frees up the memory by collecting and removing the unreferenced objects
